Introduction
======================================
Exceptions are a fact of life. As developers, we need to be prepared to deal
with them in the most graceful manner possible. Seam Catch provides a simple,
yet robust foundation for modules and/or applications to establish a customized
exception handling process. By employing a delegation model, Catch allows
exceptions to be addressed in a centralized, extensible and uniform manner.

In this guide, we'll explore the various options you have for handling
exceptions using Catch, as well as how framework authors can offer Catch
integration.
